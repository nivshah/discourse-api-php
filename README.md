# How to Use

Just include it with Composer:
 `composer require pnoeric/discourse-api-php`

And then:

```PHP
// set up key in Discourse first - recommend system key for all users
$key = 'my-secret-discourse-api-key';
$hostname = 'forums.example.com';

$api = new \pnoeric\DiscourseAPI($hostname, $key);

// and you're off and running!
// look through the src/DiscourseAPI.php file for methods
// for example:
$api->getTopTopics();

// if you aren't sure what the API results, just look at it:
$results = $api->getUserByDiscourseId( 1 );
var_dump($results);
```
